<h2><a name="sdp_t" href="#sdp_c">Software Development Principles</a></h2>

<br>

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: This principle emphasizes the importance of reusing code and avoiding duplication. It encourages developers to write code that is reusable, modular, and maintainable.

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: This principle promotes simplicity in software development. It encourages developers to write simple, clear, and straightforward code that is easy to understand and maintain.

**YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: This principle advises developers not to implement functionality until it is actually needed. It encourages developers to avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.

**SOLID**: SOLID is an acronym for five design principles - Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. These principles help in designing modular, maintainable, and extensible software.

**Agile Principles**: Agile principles, as defined in the Agile Manifesto, emphasize iterative and incremental development, collaboration, and responding to change. These principles guide the development process and promote adaptability, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD is a software development approach that involves writing automated tests before writing the actual code. This principle ensures that the code is thoroughly tested and helps in maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.

**Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: CI/CD principles involve automating the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying software. This principle ensures that code changes are frequently integrated and tested, leading to faster feedback and more reliable releases.

**Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: SoC is a design principle that advocates splitting software into distinct modules or components, each responsible for a specific concern. This principle helps in achieving modularity, maintainability, and reusability.

**Don't Optimize Prematurely**: This principle advises developers not to optimize code for performance prematurely. It suggests focusing on writing clean and maintainable code first and optimizing it only when necessary.

**Documentation**: Documentation is an essential principle in software development. It involves writing clear, concise, and up-to-date documentation to aid understanding, maintenance, and collaboration among developers.

<h2><a name="xaas_t" href="#xaas_c">Anything as a Service (XaaS)</a></h2>

<br>

![XaaS](images/xaas.png)

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—The vendor provides the infrastructure that lets you access computing resources such as servers, storage, and networks. In this model, the user is responsible for everything related to the maintenance of the infrastructure and the scalability of the application.

Top IaaS Providers

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
2. Microsoft Azure - Azure Virtual Machines
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Google Compute Engine (GCE)
4. IBM Cloud - IBM Virtual Servers
5. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) - Oracle Compute
6. Alibaba Cloud - Elastic Compute Service (ECS)

### Container as a Service (CaaS)

> An intermediate model between the IaaS and the PaaS, it refers to a form of container-based virtualization. Unlike an IaaS model, where a developer manages the virtual machine to which the service is deployed, with CaaS, you deploy your microservices in a lightweight, portable virtual container (such as Docker) to a cloud provider. The cloud provider runs the virtual server the container is running on, as well as the provider’s comprehensive tools for building, deploying, monitoring, and scaling containers.

Top CaaS Providers

1. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
2. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
3. Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
4. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
5. Docker Enterprise
6. Red Hat OpenShift

### Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS)

Managed Kubernetes Providers

- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
	- [Google Kubernetes Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/)
	- [Google Kubernetes Engine pricing](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing?hl=en)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
- Red Hat OpenShift Online and Dedicated
- VMware Cloud PKS
- Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)
- Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE). Best for startups.
- OVHCloud K8s. Best for cost.

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

> Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. PaaS frees developers from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.
>
> This model provides a platform and an environment that **allow users to focus on the development, execution, and maintenance of the application**. The applications can be created with **tools that are provided by the vendor** (for example, **operating system, database management systems, technical support, storage, hosting, network, and more**). Users do not need to invest in a physical infrastructure, nor spend time managing it, allowing them to concentrate exclusively on the development of applications.

Top PaaS Providers

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed PaaS offering by Amazon Web Services. It supports various programming languages and platforms, providing an easy way to deploy and scale applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. 
2. Microsoft Azure App Service
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine
4. Heroku: Heroku is a popular PaaS provider known for its simplicity and ease of use. It supports several programming languages and frameworks, making it easy to deploy and scale applications. Heroku provides a seamless integration with Git and offers a wide range of add-ons for additional functionality.

### Function as a Service (FaaS)

> FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.

FaaS Providers

1. [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
2. Microsoft Azure Functions
3. Google Cloud Functions
4. IBM Cloud Functions
5. Alibaba Cloud Function Compute
6. Oracle Functions

NOTE If you’re not careful, FaaS-based platforms can lock your code into a cloud vendor platform because your code is deployed to a vendor-specific runtime engine. With a FaaS-based model, you might be writing your service using a general programming language (Java, Python, JavaScript, and so on), but you’re still tying yourself to the underlying vendor’s APIs and runtime engine that your function will be deployed to.

### Artificial intelligence as a Service (AIaaS)

> Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) is the third party offering of artificial intelligence (AI) outsourcing. AI as a service allows individuals and companies to experiment with AI for various purposes without large initial investment and with lower risk.

AIaaS Providers

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview)

### Backend as a Service (BaaS)

>Backend as a Service (BaaS), also known as Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS), is a cloud computing model that provides developers with a pre-built backend infrastructure for their applications. It allows developers to focus on building the frontend or client-side of their applications without worrying about server-side infrastructure management.

>In BaaS, the backend infrastructure, including servers, databases, storage, and other resources, is provided and managed by a third-party service provider. Developers can access these services through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to perform tasks such as data storage, user authentication, push notifications, file storage, and more.

Top BaaS Providers

1. Firebase: Firebase, owned by Google, offers a comprehensive suite of backend services, including real-time database, authentication, hosting, storage, and more.
2. AWS Amplify: Amplify, provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers a range of services for building scalable and secure applications, including authentication, storage, APIs, and more.
3. Parse: Parse is an open-source BaaS platform that provides services like database management, user authentication, push notifications, and cloud storage.

### Software as a service (SaaS)

> Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

Top SaaS Companies

- Adobe
- Atlassian
- Freshworks

### Software Design, OOD


<details>
    <summary>The five basic principles of object-oriented design (SOLID)</summary>

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, and it should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks. By adhering to this principle, each class becomes more focused and maintains a high level of cohesion.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): This principle emphasizes that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means that once a class is created and tested, it should not be modified to add new functionality. Instead, new features should be added by creating new classes or modules that inherit from or depend upon the existing ones.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, any derived class should be able to be used in place of its base class without causing unexpected behavior or breaking the program's logic.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes the idea of creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than a single large interface. By doing so, it avoids the problem of clients being forced to implement methods they don't need, thereby reducing coupling and increasing flexibility.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes directly. Both should depend on abstractions. It encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts between modules, allowing for interchangeable implementations. This promotes loose coupling and facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and modifications.

### Container Orchestration

#### <img src="/assets/icon/engineering/Kubernetes.svg" width="24px"/>Kubernetes (K8s)

/k(j)uːbəˈnɛtɪs/

>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

>Kubernetes intends to radically simplify the task of building, deploying, and maintaining distributed systems. It has been inspired by decades of real-world experience building reliable systems, and it has been designed from the ground up to make that experience if not euphoric, at least pleasant.

>Containers and orchestrators enable developers to build and deploy applications with a speed, agility, and reliability.

<details>
<summary>When to use it or not</summary>

If your application is a large monolith, you definitely don’t need Kubernetes.

Even if you deploy microservices, using Kubernetes may not be the best option, especially if the number of your microservices is very small.

If your system consists of less than five microservices, throwing Kubernetes into the mix is probably not a good idea. If your system has more than twenty microservices, you will most likely benefit from the integration of Kubernetes. If the number of your microservices falls somewhere in between, other factors should be considered, such as invest your engineers’ time into learning Kubernetes, increased costs.

Microservice-based applications are more difficult to manage than monolithic applications. The more microservices you have, the more you need to automate their management with a system like Kubernetes.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Kubernetes 的理解</summary>

K8s 整体是一个分布式的高可用架构，运行这个架构之上的应用不需要应用本身具有高可用的特点(降低应用开发者的门槛)，而可以借助架构的能力让应用高可用。

本质上是高级版的 docker ，管理计算机 CPU 、内存、磁盘等资源。到时候还的加各种入 gateway 、分布式文件系统、告警链路等一堆东西。

Components

- **Pods**, or groups of containers, can group together container images developed by different teams into a single deployable unit.
- **Kubernetes services** provide load balancing, naming, and discovery to isolate one microservice from another.
- **Namespaces** provide isolation and access control, so that each microservice can control the degree to which other services interact with it.
- **Ingress objects** provide an easy-to-use frontend that can combine multiple microservices into a single externalized API surface area.

Istio, Linkerd, Kuma, App Mesh and Consul

- **Istio**, popularity wise, is the current leader in service mesh space. Features-wise, it's the most powerful and advanced mesh. The **most popular** service mesh framework.
- **Linkerd** is the most performant and focused service mesh out there. It’s intentionally small, with carefully selected feature set, convenient dashboard and a strong focus on doing just enough. Production-ready **lightweight** service mesh.
- **Kuma** is one of the newest service meshes, aimed at solving many of the mistakes other meshes did. It was built in response to the previous service mesh frameworks’ issue of being heavy and difficult to manage or operate.
- **AWS App Mesh**, which is a fully managed service mesh intended for Amazon-specific services.
- **Consul Connect** is probably the most mature simply because of Consul. Consul is a decade old , polished technology, battle tested in huge production environments. It’s a safe choice in terms of stability and features. There is only one problem with Consul Connect: it’s a not a purpose-built cloud native service mesh, but rather a service mesh built on top of Consul.

Extreme Programming (XP)

> Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development methodology that prioritizes customer satisfaction, adaptability, and high-quality software. It involves iterative development, continuous planning, small releases, pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, and close collaboration with an onsite customer representative. XP aims to deliver working software frequently, respond quickly to changes, and maintain a sustainable and productive team environment.

- **Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change** (2nd, 2004) by Kent Beck [4.12, 3939]

Scrum

> Scrum is an Agile framework that follows an iterative and incremental approach. It divides the project into time-bound iterations called "sprints" and employs a cross-functional team to deliver working software at the end of each sprint. Scrum emphasizes close collaboration, regular meetings (sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review, and retrospective), and a product backlog for prioritizing and managing work.

Kanban

/ˈkɑnˌbɑn/

> Kanban is another Agile methodology that visualizes the workflow using a Kanban board. It focuses on limiting work-in-progress, optimizing flow, and continuously improving the delivery process. Kanban provides clear visibility into the status of each task and helps teams identify bottlenecks and optimize their work.
