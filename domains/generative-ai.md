**Model context protocol (MCP)**

> An open standard designed to bridge AI assistants with the world of data and tools, to plug in many different sources of context.

>An open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
