Directions

<details>
    <summary>C/C++的大体方向</summary>
<br>

主要方向：

1. 图形图像/QT。
2. 音视频。实际上也是要分开，比如音频主要代表的有声网，科大讯飞等。
3. 网络。虚拟化，网络安全等。
4. 功能开发。一些原来是 C/C++架构的成熟产品，迭代开发。
5. 嵌入式。嵌入式分得领域非常多，存储，单片机，车载，机械。
6. 医疗。医疗可以单独拿出来，算一个分类。
7. 金融。要求高，不好进。
8. 游戏。游戏分前端 u3d 之类，与图形图像有关联。服务器后端，主要就是高并发网络通信，与金融相关。

C++ 不像 Java 那样 Spring 技术框架一统天下。意思就是方向非常专一，同样是 C++，你在某个圈子深耕三年，换个方向相当于从零开始。

C++ 不是特殊场景，一般不会用它。1. 它太难掌握，对开发要求高，出一个难以复现的问题，定位解决起来半年都是可能的。2. 因为1的原因，变相的导致对开发人员素质要求高，从而推高用人成本高，同时开发效率和稳定性也不如 java 尤其是脚本语言，从公司运营成本角度，就没有意愿选择 C++。

目前坑位多的就是 QT 客户端，音视频，服务器。再者就是嵌入式，偏硬件。高阶的就是存储，量化。高阶的没经验肯定是进不去的。C++没三五年经验可以说是语法都掌握不全。

就业方面，现在大中小公司能不用 C++，他们是绝对不用 C++的，所以坑位最多的 QT 客户端份额逐渐被套壳 js 侵蚀，坑位越来越少。

建议：

图形图像算是不错的一个分类。

游戏，建议不要入。1. 因为太累，版本更新，熬夜加班太正常了。2. 游戏和金融一样，压力大，服务器一秒钟都不能停，有 bug ，一群人盯着不断问。3. 游戏行业并不是需求大的方向，头部效应非常明显，底下的完全喝不到汤。

    <summary>对Go的理解</summary>

个人以为，Golang 是类型安全的 C ，仅此而已。Go 的编写负担会比 C 低很多，同时也还有不错的执行效率。但是和其他高级语言比，语法上几乎没什么优越性，在不使用 CGO 的情况下，能够非常方便的跨平台编译，勉强能算一个。

--

服务器用 Go 最省钱, 举个例子,一个后台用 Go 写 6MB, Node 60MB, Java 300MB。

--

go 在 devops 工具开发这个领域没什么对手。

--

golang 就是屎味的巧克力，它的 native 、并发、内存占用低、交叉编译等都是巧克力。但你想吃这个巧克力，就得忍受它语法简陋和各个奇怪的设计（如 if err 、2006-01-02 15:04:05 等）的屎，我用 golang 一般都是一边捏着鼻子一边写的。

--

go 就是一帮写 c 语言的搞出来的云原生时代的 better C ，虽然有很多缺点但是是实实在在的解决了他们最关心的几个痛点，你们在乎的恰恰是他们不太在乎的。

--

Go 的标准库对于业务来说支持的方法是挺简陋的，现在要需要引入三方库，好在生态已经逐渐完善，有很多库可用。go 对于 java 的优势应该主要是原生协程、编译型语言。也确实没有一个特别好用的 orm 库（现在的 goframe 的 orm 组件还行 >> gorm ）。怎么说，要一个开发效率与性能齐驱的语言，目前还是没看到的。  
对于 Java ，个人很讨厌其语法上的臃肿。
rust 其实能够做到开发效率与性能齐驱，无奈上手成本过高，只能覆盖小众方向。
Golang 的定位就是 better C ，我司（某所）在嵌入式 CPU 上运行 web server ，拿 C 开发 web 后端就是折磨，Golang 是从众多语言中被筛选出来的，兼顾运行速度，平台兼容性，交叉编译工具链，库丰富度，内存安全，离线开发等特性，作为一名从 C 里解脱出来的开发人员已经非常知足且感激 Google 了。

--

项目原因,我只能选 go ： 

1. 运行在客户端的,而 go 可以直接生成二进制,不用考虑加密。  
2. 不依赖环境,运行方便  
3. 性能,才 17mb,还是用来 beego 框架,cpu 基本是 0%

--

在主流语言中，Go 是在开发效率，运行效率，还有运维成本三个方面做到了最好的平衡，再吐槽也没用，这个生态位只有 Go 一个选择。

    <summary>关于 Go Web 框架 - Click to expand!</summary>
不建议用 Go 写 Web ，可以用来完成一些基础设施类工作。Go 这边的 Web 框架，比如 gin 那种，其实都是非常轻量级的，属于 http 增强库，和 spring 全家桶不是一回事。Go 这边我觉得可以认为不具有诞生 springboot 类的土壤。

Go 的 Web 框架基本都是标准库套壳。也可以看看 fiber 这种用 fasthttp 的。

Go 是用来写底层服务的，不适合写应用层面的东西。

gin，其他想要什么组件可以自己加上去。

可以自己试着用用，组合出一套顺手的技术栈。

>C (1972), Pascal (1970), Fortran (1957), BASIC (1964), Ada (1980), COBOL (1959)

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

> C++ (1985), C# (2000), Java (1995)

> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged as a response to the limitations of procedural programming and to address the growing complexity of software systems.

> OOP has become a dominant programming paradigm in software development because it helps to manage complexity, encourages good design practices, and facilitates collaboration among developers. As systems grew larger and more complex, the need for these benefits became more apparent, driving the adoption of OOP in both academic and commercial software development.

**Functional Programming (FP)**

> Haskell (2010), Scala (2004), Clojure (2007), F# (2005)

>While functional programming isn't universally applicable to all problems or scenarios, it provides powerful abstractions, promotes clarity of thought, and addresses many challenges faced by developers in the modern software landscape. As a result, many languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and even Java, have incorporated functional programming concepts alongside traditional paradigms.

<h2><a name="mfp_t" href="#mfp_c">Metaphors for Programming</a></h2>

<br>

**Metaphor 1**

Six months ago I'd never written a single line of code in my life. I applied to the Coding House dev bootcamp, got accepted and will be graduating next month. I feel super confident about my programming skills now and pumped to put them to work.

Learning to code is like learning a foreign language. You start out with a few basic words and phrases. Then you learn some grammar. Then you learn more words and phrases. Then you learn some more grammar. Then you learn some colloquialisms and slang. Then you learn some more words and phrases. Then you learn some more grammar. Rinse and repeat forever (because "fluency" is a nebulous concept).

When you learn to code, it's the exact same thing. You're learning the language to communicate with technology. Unfortunately, your computer is generally less forgiving than the locals. When you don't know how to ask for another drink at the bar, you can usually get by with "biru" in your funny foreigner accent and one finger held up in the air. When you throw some imperfect code at your machine, though, it'll throw an error in your face at best, or just stare condescendingly at you until you find your mistake (an hour later) and fix it.

When you learn to code, like when you learn a foreign language, you have to adapt your way of thinking to this new environment of communication. In Japanese, the verb comes last, so you start to put more thought into receiver of the action in your communication. In Javascript, the code executes logically, in order, line by line from the top, so you also have to think logically, in order, step by step through your code. And of course, there are always exceptions to the rules (async operations woo!).

Probably the most important parallel, though, is the persistence required to get good at a foreign language, or at coding. You're going to fail. A lot. Then you're going to get a little better. Then you're going to fail even more. You have to accept this constant state of not knowing and the possibility of failure if you want to improve. Eventually you'll look back and realize that you're having a conversation with that bartender now and getting her number. Eventually you'll realize you can spin up a server, design a website or make an app, despite how much you thought you sucked at all this and probably should've just given up a long time ago.

So dive in and get your hands dirty! Break your machine, then learn how to put it all back together again. The journey of a thousand miles and all that jazz.

**2. How to explain coding concepts like streams, promises, linting, and declarative programming to a 5-year-old**

I love thinking about coding concepts by comparing them to familiar things we know in life. There are so many analogies out there about coding concepts. Some of them are good while others are confusing, mainly because they focus on partial aspects of a concept while ignoring many others. This article will summarize some of the analogies that I think best fit a few coding concepts in complete ways.

I will start with simple concepts and move on to harder ones. Let’s start with coding itself. Coding can be compared to writing cooking recipes. A recipe in this analogy is the program and the cook is the computer. A recipe is a list of instructions for a cook to follow and a program is a list of instructions for a computer to execute.

This is a very simple analogy given that a recipe is written in a human language and a program is written in a computer language and those are very different languages (unless your recipes have closures and promises!). There are also not a lot of unexpected things to plan for in a recipe while a computer program will have many. Regardless of its simplicity, it is a good way to show how a computer carries out a list of instructions sequentially. It also shows where one instruction line can use any result from executing prior instruction lines.

Some recipes will even have if-statements: if cooking for 2, 4 or 8! Some recipes will have loops: keep beating that mix until…

I also like this analogy because of all the ready items and tools that you can use in your recipes — like the cake mix that you can use to make cupcakes and that specially-shaped pan that makes it so much easier to create cupcakes.

The use of ready items and tools is like including and using a package of code written by others in your own code.

```
// The making of a cupcake// First steps:
```

```
$ npm install cake-mix $ npm install cupcake-pan
```

NPM is the package manager for Node.js, which a very popular framework for writing JavaScript applications. In this analogy, Node.js is like the kitchen itself. It allows you to execute lines in your recipes by using built-in modules like your oven and sink.

Speaking of unhealthy food, this next analogy is for learning how to code and is compared to eating habits. I particularly LOVE this analogy and what it conveys because it helps me to stay on track in my code learning journey. For me, this began in high school and will continue until my brain reaches its last instruction: die();

<h2><a name="mfpl_t" href="#mfpl_c">Metaphors for Programming Languages</a></h2>

<br>

**1. Think of Programming Languages as Workshops**

Python, all the latest power tools, including a few that might not work perfectly, but they're new and nothing is going to cut your hand off or give you tetanus.

C/C++, this is grandpa's barn. All the tools are there, somewhere, but watch out for the black widows and rusted nails sticking up. Oh yeah, everything is hand powered, even the drill and metal lathe.

Rust, the above minus all the old, broken and dirty cruft. Very useful when the power goes out.

FORTRAN, the ultimate high power assembly line. Great for crunching numbers. Heaven help you if you want to do anything else.

Haskell, every CNC machine ever made, clean, works great, totally dust, dirt and grime free. No manuals or displays, however. Those would create side effects.

Erlang, all kinds of little workers in cubicles only able to do one job each. Lots of fun watching stuff being shuttled through old style vacuum transportation tubes.

LISP, a furnace, anvil, crucible, ingot mold, hammer, tongs, pile of coal and pile of scrap metal. Make your own bleeding tools!

Assembly, a hole in the ground containing ore. Get digging, after you make a shovel, of course.

This is actually a lot of fun to do and really points out weaknesses and strengths of different languages.
