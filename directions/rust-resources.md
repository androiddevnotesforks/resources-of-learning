>Rust is a new systems programming language that combines the performance and low-level control of C and C++ with memory safety and thread safety.

>Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

>The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.

### Advanced

- Advanced
	- **Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development** (2021) by Jason Orendorff and Jim Blandy [4.63, 584] This book explains how Rust manages to bridge the gap between performance and safety, and how you can take advantage of it.
	- **Rust for Rustaceans: Idiomatic Programming for Experienced Developers** (2021) by Jon Gjengset [4.53, 300] For developers who’ve mastered the basics, this book is the next step on your way to professional-level programming in Rust.
	- Code Like a Pro in Rust (2024) by Brenden Matthews [4.07, 27] This hands-on guide dives deep into memory management, asynchronous programming, and Rust design patterns and explores essential productivity techniques like testing, tooling, and project management.
	- Refactoring to Rust (2025) by Lily Mara, Joel Holmes
	- Advanced Hands-on Rust: Level Up Your Coding Skills (2025) by Herbert Wolverson. This book is the ideal follow-up to take the skills you gained in Hands-on Rust to the next level - or it can be read stand-alone once you've mastered basic Rust.
- Concurrency

## Directions

>Rust is primarily used in fields that require high performance, memory safety, and concurrent programming—without a garbage collector. It is increasingly popular in systems programming, web backends, cryptography, and embedded development.

| Field                     | Example Use Cases                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Systems Programming       | OS kernels, device drivers, low-level libraries |
| Web Development           | High-performance APIs, web backends             |
| Blockchain & Cryptography | Consensus engines, smart contracts, wallets     |
| Embedded & IoT            | Microcontroller firmware, bare-metal apps       |
| Game Development          | Game engines, simulation engines                |
| Command-Line Tools        | DevOps utilities, Unix-like tools               |
| WebAssembly (Wasm)        | Browser plugins, web app components             |
