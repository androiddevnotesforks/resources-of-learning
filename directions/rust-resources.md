## Directions

>Rust is primarily used in fields that require high performance, memory safety, and concurrent programmingâ€”without a garbage collector. It is increasingly popular in systems programming, web backends, cryptography, and embedded development.

| Field                     | Example Use Cases                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Systems Programming       | OS kernels, device drivers, low-level libraries |
| Web Development           | High-performance APIs, web backends             |
| Blockchain & Cryptography | Consensus engines, smart contracts, wallets     |
| Embedded & IoT            | Microcontroller firmware, bare-metal apps       |
| Game Development          | Game engines, simulation engines                |
| Command-Line Tools        | DevOps utilities, Unix-like tools               |
| WebAssembly (Wasm)        | Browser plugins, web app components             |
