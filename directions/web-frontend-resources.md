Headless UI library

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). 
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

Note

1. shdcn/ui is NOT a component library. When you take a component from shadcn/ui, from that moment it becomes YOUR component. If there’s a problem, well, it’s YOUR problem. Unlike the other UI libraries we’re used to deal with where bugs are fixed with npm update, this is not exactly the case with shadcn.
2. shdcn/ui is built on top of radix, what happens if radix has a bug? The easy answer is that you can simply update it and the bug is gone, but then what if something else breaks on shad because of the radix update? Maybe it’s not gonna happen that often, but as mentioned, if there’s a bug, it’s your problem.

<h2><a name="ltwt_t" href="#ltwt_c">Lightweight JS Frameworks</a></h2>
<br>

>**Svelte and SolidJS** are gaining traction for their performance benefits and simplicity.



**Svelte**

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sveltejs/svelte)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/sveltejs/svelte)   ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/sveltejs/svelte)  ![GitHub Created At](https://img.shields.io/github/created-at/sveltejs/svelte) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/svelte)

>Svelte is a relatively new framework that shifts the work of the framework to the compile step, producing highly efficient JavaScript at build time. It eliminates the need for a virtual DOM and delivers great performance with a simple syntax.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Cybernetically enhanced web apps. Write less code, no virtual DOM, truly reactive. 

**Preact**

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/preactjs/preact)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/preactjs/preact)   ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/preactjs/preact)  ![GitHub Created At](https://img.shields.io/github/created-at/preactjs/preact) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/preact)

>Preact is a lightweight, swift, high-performance library and alternative to React. Preact is merely 3kb in size (minified and gzipped) and yet gives you all the necessary functionality of React, making it one of the best JavaScript frameworks.

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

**SolidJS**

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/solidjs/solid)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/solidjs/solid)   ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/solidjs/solid)  ![GitHub Created At](https://img.shields.io/github/created-at/solidjs/solid) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/solid-js)

>SolidJS is a reactive JavaScript library with a focus on performance. It updates the DOM directly without a virtual DOM, using a fine-grained reactivity system similar to frameworks like Knockout or MobX.

<h2><a name="headless_ui_t" href="#headless_ui_c">Headless UI</a></h2>
<br>

>**Headless UI** is a term for libraries and utilities that provide the logic, state, processing and API for UI elements and interactions, but **do not provide markup, styles, or pre-built implementations**.

>Advantages of headless UI: 1) Full control over markup and styles. 2) Supports all styling patterns (CSS, CSS-in-JS, UI libraries, etc). 3) Smaller bundle-sizes. Portable. 4) Run anywhere JS runs.

>**If you want a lighter-weight component or full control over the design**, then you should consider using a headless table library.

>Headless UI runs on a vanilla JavaScript core. It can be used in any framework, including React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Qwik, Angular, and even JS-to-native platforms like React Native.

### Web Application Frameworks (API)

>Express.js, Koa.js, Fastify, Nest.js

<details>
<summary>On Web Application Frameworks</summary>

Fastify is more or less an alternative to Express while NestJS adds (suggests) some architecture to an application like dependency injection and modularization which is nice if your application grows (and in my opinion in general). NestJS uses express or fastify under the hood.

--

Fastify and Express are very similar - minimal. Nest is opinionated and have a lot of boilerplate, but overkill is subjective. If you think its too much boiler plate for a straight forward API collection for your start up don't use it.

--

Express could be suitable for most of the cases, it also depends if you need third party integration since most of the packages are available in express.

--

In terms of structure, Fastify is pretty much the same thing as Express. NestJS is a lot of glue code and boilerplate on top of Express or Fastify.

</details>

<details>
<summary>框架选择</summary>

大而全那当然是使用 nest。

能选肯定是选 Nest ，以前总是想着小而美，回过头来还不如 Nest 自己帮你做完所有事。

nestjs ，基本都是用这个，大部分功能都是开箱即用，也有很多周边插件。

喜欢面向对象用 Nest, 觉得太重不喜欢就 Express, Fastify.

nestjs 跟 java 的 spring 差不多，该有的功能都有了，适合特别喜欢依赖注入的 java/angular 人
nestjs 做的事比 fastify/express 这些 http 框架多一些，某些场景下它们会一起出现，如果是中小型项目直接用 Fastify/Express/egg 也行。

### SPA vs Full-Stack

1\. When a SPA (React, Vue, Angular) is enough

When SEO is **not the primary concern**, and you want a rich, app-like experience:

- Internal business tools / dashboards  
    (e.g., admin panels, analytics dashboards, SaaS back-office UIs) → only logged-in users, SEO irrelevant.
- Single-user workflows  
    (e.g., project management apps, IDEs in the browser, CRMs).
- Desktop-like feel  
    Fast in-app navigation, no page reloads, lots of client-side interactivity.
- Mostly behind auth  
    If all pages require login, crawlers won’t index anyway.
- You control the traffic  
    If users arrive via direct links, email invites, or your app marketplace, SEO doesn’t matter.

2\. When a Full-stack Framework (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix) is better

when **SEO, performance, or content reach matters**:

- Marketing websites / landing pages  
    Need Google ranking → SSR/SSG ensures content + metadata is instantly visible.
- Blogs, news, or content-heavy sites  
    Content changes often → SSG/ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) gives best mix of SEO + speed.
- E-commerce sites  
    Product pages must rank well in search engines; SSR/SSG helps them get indexed fast.
- Hybrid apps  
    Mix of public content (SEO-friendly) and private sections (SPA-like interactivity).
- When performance is critical  
    Core Web Vitals affect ranking; full-stack frameworks have image optimization, prefetching, and code splitting out of the box.

3\. Rule of Thumb

- If your app is mostly for users you already have → SPA is fine.
- If you need users to find you via Google → use a full-stack framework.
- Many real projects end up hybrid:
    - Public pages = SSR/SSG
    - Auth-only app shell = SPA
