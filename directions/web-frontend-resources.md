<h2><a name="ltwt_t" href="#ltwt_c">Lightweight JS Frameworks</a></h2>
<br>

>**Svelte and SolidJS** are gaining traction for their performance benefits and simplicity.



**Svelte**

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sveltejs/svelte)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/sveltejs/svelte)   ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/sveltejs/svelte)  ![GitHub Created At](https://img.shields.io/github/created-at/sveltejs/svelte) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/svelte)

>Svelte is a relatively new framework that shifts the work of the framework to the compile step, producing highly efficient JavaScript at build time. It eliminates the need for a virtual DOM and delivers great performance with a simple syntax.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Cybernetically enhanced web apps. Write less code, no virtual DOM, truly reactive. 

**Preact**

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/preactjs/preact)  ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/preactjs/preact)   ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/preactjs/preact)  ![GitHub Created At](https://img.shields.io/github/created-at/preactjs/preact) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/preact)

>Preact is a lightweight, swift, high-performance library and alternative to React. Preact is merely 3kb in size (minified and gzipped) and yet gives you all the necessary functionality of React, making it one of the best JavaScript frameworks.

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). Fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

**SolidJS**

<h2><a name="headless_ui_t" href="#headless_ui_c">Headless UI</a></h2>
<br>

>**Headless UI** is a term for libraries and utilities that provide the logic, state, processing and API for UI elements and interactions, but **do not provide markup, styles, or pre-built implementations**.

>Advantages of headless UI: 1) Full control over markup and styles. 2) Supports all styling patterns (CSS, CSS-in-JS, UI libraries, etc). 3) Smaller bundle-sizes. Portable. 4) Run anywhere JS runs.

>**If you want a lighter-weight component or full control over the design**, then you should consider using a headless table library.

>Headless UI runs on a vanilla JavaScript core. It can be used in any framework, including React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, Qwik, Angular, and even JS-to-native platforms like React Native.

### Full Stack Frameworks of Node.js

> Fastify is more or less an alternative to Express while NestJS adds (suggests) some architecture to an application like dependency injection and modularization which is nice if your application grows (and in my opinion in general). NestJS uses express or fastify under the hood.

> Fastify and Express are very similar - minimal. Nest is opinionated and have a lot of boilerplate, but overkill is subjective. If you think its too much boiler plate for a straight forward API collection for your start up don't use it.

> Express could be suitable for most of the cases, it also depends if you need third party integration since most of the packages are available in express.

> In terms of structure, Fastify is pretty much the same thing as Express. NestJS is a lot of glue code and boilerplate on top of Express or Fastify.
