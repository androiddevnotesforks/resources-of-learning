    <summary>关于游戏开发</summary>

能熬夜加班到 2-3 点就行，其他不重要。

游戏行业最大的特点基本是赢家通吃，如果你进不了头部几家公司，其他公司基本生存维艰。

做游戏不如写游戏脚本，入门快，获取收益快，做国外的就行。

国内的做游戏的得看能不能跟好的项目，好的项目非常非常少，其它的 90% 都是熬时间、做功能， 加班能加到你吐，加班到凌晨 2-3 点也是常事，再牛逼的热情也会给你浇灭了。

### Key-Value Databases 

>Key-Value databases store data as pairs of keys and values. Each key is unique, and the corresponding value can be a simple data type or a complex object. 

>Key-Value databases are excellent for simple, high-speed access to individual values based on unique keys.

>Use Cases: Caching, user sessions, shopping carts, and other scenarios where rapid lookups by unique identifiers are essential.

### Document Databases

>Document databases store data in documents, which are typically JSON, BSON, or XML format. Each document is a self-contained data unit that can contain nested structures. 

>Document databases offer more complex data structures and querying capabilities suitable for applications that require handling rich, nested data.

>Use Cases: Content management systems, e-commerce applications, real-time analytics, and data that naturally fits into a document structure.

>Store data in columns rather than rows, which can improve performance for queries involving large datasets with sparse data.

>Use Cases: Data warehousing, analytics, and real-time data processing.

Cassandra, HBase

### Graph Databases

>Designed to handle data structured as graphs, where entities are nodes and relationships are edges, suitable for representing and querying interconnected data.

>Use Cases: Social networks, recommendations, fraud detection, and network analysis.

Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

### Time Series Databases (TSDB)

>Specifically designed to handle time-stamped data and optimized for time-based queries and aggregations.

>Use Cases: Monitoring systems, IoT data management, financial market analysis.

<details>
    <summary>消息队列选型</summary>

性能优先选 Kafka，有事务需求选 RabbitMQ。除非用 Spring Alibaba 那一套，否则不会考虑 rocketmq，http 协议才有多语言 sdk，生态差太多了。

事务型：RabbitMQ，流量型：Kafka。

业务量不大，只是要一个稳定不出问题的消息队列。RabbitMQ 最少这个选择不会错。因为太成熟了。

只用主流和支持多语言的。低吞吐，部署简单的，用 RabbitMQ。大流量大吞吐的，用 kafka。

不建议 redis 业务稍微上来点就要重构。

#### Open AI

- [Open AI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview)

### Model context protocol (MCP)

> An open standard designed to bridge AI assistants with the world of data and tools, to plug in many different sources of context.

>An open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.
